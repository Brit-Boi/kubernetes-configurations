# Kubernetes k3s Proxy
A Load Balancer for use of connecting the two k3s nodes together.

# My example
 - Using NGINX with a custom configuration 
   - `nginx.conf` included in this directory
 - Running NGINX in a Docker container for easier setup/teardown of services
   - `docker-compose.yml` included in this directory
